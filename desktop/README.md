# Desktop

The desktop component is an electron app. It uses a hybrid setup. The sidebar to view servers and the main window used to add servers are bundled. After selecting a server the main window gets overlayed by a BrowserView showing the frontend of an external deployment with the actual WorkAdventure frontend.
