# Work Adventure

## Work in progress

Work Adventure is a web-based collaborative workspace for small to medium teams (2-100 people) presented in the form of a
16-bit video game.

In Work Adventure, you can move around your office and talk to your colleagues (using a video-chat feature that is
triggered when you move next to a colleague).
