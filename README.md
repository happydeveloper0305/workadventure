# Work Adventure

## Work in progress

Work Adventure is a web-based collaborative workspace for small to medium teams (2-100 people) presented in the form of a
16-bit video game.

In Work Adventure, you can move around your office and talk to your colleagues (using a video-chat feature that is
triggered when you move next to a colleague).


## Getting started

Install Docker.

Run:

```
docker-compose up
```

The environment will start.

You should now be able to browse to http://workadventure.localhost/ and see the application.

Note: on some OSes, you will need to add this line to your `/etc/hosts` file:

**/etc/hosts**
```
workadventure.localhost 127.0.0.1
```
