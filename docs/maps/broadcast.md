# Broadcasting / Megaphone
Use the broadcast feature to stream your video / audio / screen to anyone.

Let's comment this part as it is not implemented yet

<!--
### Area map editor
Use the broadcast feature to stream your video / audio / screen to anyone within the **broadcast zone**.

To use the broadcast feature, you must first define a speaker zone and a listener zone :

- The **listener zone** : anyone within this zone will be able to hear/see the speakers that are in the speaker zone.
- The **speaker zone** : you can start streaming by :
  - either clicking the "megaphone" icon (if the megaphone is authorized in that zone).
  - or by walking on the "stage". The "stage" is a special zone that will stream to the listener zones.
  - or by using the Scripting API.
-->

### Settings map editor (Configure my room)
You can configure the general megaphone in the "Configure my room" menu.
It will affect the entire map.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        <img src="images/megaphone_general.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="" />
    </div>
</div>

1. Open the map editor.
2. Open the "configure my room" modal.
3. Open the megaphone tab.
4. Switch on/off the general megaphone.
5. Give a unique name to your megaphone.
6. Define the scope of your megaphone, if you want to only broadcast to this map or to all maps that have the same megaphone settings (spaceName and scope).
7. To be able to manage who can use the megaphone you can add some rights restrictions. You can restrict the megaphone to a specific user or to a specific group of users by using tags.
