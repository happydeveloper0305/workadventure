# Broadcasting / Megaphone

Use the broadcast feature to stream your video / audio / screen to anyone within the **broadcast zone**.

To use the broadcast feature, you must first define a broadcast zone and a trigger:

- The **broadcast zone**: anyone within this zone will be able to hear/see you
- The **trigger**: you can start streaming by:
  - either clicking the "megaphone" icon (if the megaphone is authorized in that zone)
  - or by walking on the "stage". The "stage" is a special zone that will stream TO the broadcast zone
  - or by using the Scripting API
