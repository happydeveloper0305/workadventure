    <div class="col">
        <img src="../images/editor/area_editor.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="" />
    </div>
</div>

3. Create an area by clicking on the map directly or by selecting a zone.
<div class="px-5 card rounded d-inline-block">
    <video class="document-img" src="../images/editor/area_editor.mp4" autoplay loop muted></video>
</div>
