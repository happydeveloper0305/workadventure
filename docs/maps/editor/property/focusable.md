## Focusable property
When you make an area "focusable", the camera will automatically zoom on the area when the user enters it.
Apply this on a meeting room, for instance, to make the camera show the complete meeting room.

Focusable areas have one property: the "zoom margin".
If your focusable area is small, we advise you to set a zoom margin. The camera will zoom out a little bit from
the area. This allows zooming too much and can give a better rendering.

    <div class="col">

    </div>
</div>

## Setting focusable area :
1. When editing an area, you can add the focusable property to it. You must click on the "focusable" icon.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        <img src="../../images/editor/focusable_property.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="" />
    </div>
</div>
2. You can define the zoom level of the camera when the player enters the area.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        <img src="../../images/editor/focusable.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="" />
    </div>
</div>
