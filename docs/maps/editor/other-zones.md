# Miscellaneous areas

## Silent areas

Add a "silent" area to your map to prevent users to talk to each others (in bubbles) inside this area.

When a user enters a "silent" area, the indicator next to the Woka's name will turn red.
No-one can talk to this user, and this user cannot talk to anyone else until the area is left.

## Focusable areas

When you make an area "focusable", the camera will automatically zoom on the area when the user enters it.
Apply this on a meeting room, for instance, to make the camera show the complete meeting room.

Focusable areas have one property: the "zoom margin".
If your focusable area is small, we advise you to set a zoom margin. The camera will zoom out a little bit from 
the area. This allows zooming too much and can give a better rendering.

## "Play audio file" areas

You can automatically play music or sound effects when a user enters an area.
