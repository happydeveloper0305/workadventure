# Silent property

Add a "silent" area to your map to prevent users from talking to each others (in bubbles) inside this area.

When a user enters a "silent" area, the indicator next to the Woka's name will turn red.
No-one can talk to this user, and this user cannot talk to anyone else until the area is left.

## Setting silent area

1. When editing an area, you can add the silent property to it. You must click on the "silent" icon.
That's it ! Every user that will enter this area will be muted and won't be able to talk to each others.
