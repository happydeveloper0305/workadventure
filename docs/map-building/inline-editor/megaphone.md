2. Click the "configure my room" icon. A configuration modal will appear.
3. Navigate to the megaphone tab.
4. Toggle the megaphone on or off.
5. Assign a unique name to your megaphone.

If you select "world", the megaphone's reach will extend across multiple rooms. Individuals in any room configured with the same "space name" will be able to hear you when the megaphone is enabled.
7. Manage the megaphone's usage by applying rights restrictions. You can limit the megaphone's access to specific users or user groups using tags.
