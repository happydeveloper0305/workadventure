# Self-hosting WorkAdventure using Kubernetes Helm chart

> [!WARNING]
> If you haven't already, please check the [Setting up a self-hosted production environment](../../docs/others/self-hosting/install.md) guide
> before getting started.

This Helm chart deploys Workadventure on Kubernetes.

## Installation

    helm repo add workadventure https://charts.workadventu.re/
    helm install workadventure workadventure/workadventure

## Version numbering and upgrading

Versions of the Helm chart are aligned with the versions of the WorkAdventure Docker image. 
When a new version of the WorkAdventure Docker images are released, a new version of the Helm chart is released as well.

> [!WARNING]
> This Helm chart is newer than the [Docker Compose install](../docker/README.md) and might change more frequently in the 
> coming month. Therefore, we do not (yet) guarantee the absence of breaking changes between minor or patch versions.
> When upgrading, please check changes in `values.yaml`. We will try to document breaking changes in the 
> [release notes](https://github.com/workadventure/workadventure/releases).


## Configuration

The chart is designed to work out of the box with the minimum required configuration.

The two compulsory parameters you need to provide are:
- the `domainName` parameter that should point to the domain name that will host WorkAdventure.
- the `mÌ€apstorage.secretEnv.AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD` parameter that you should set to a password to access the map-storage container.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that this chart does not provide SSL certificates generation by default.
> It is your responsibility to ensure certificates are correctly handled (either by providing
> one in an appropriate secret, by using CertManager to generate certificates automatically
> or by using Traefik as a reverse proxy properly configured to generate certificates).

There is a corresponding `xxx-secret-env.yaml` file and a `xxx-env.yaml` file, which contains 
all environments variables. There are many pre initialized variables in the template files
(all variables relative to the URLs). Additional entries can be easily added in the corresponding 
sections of the values file.

There are the `commonEnv` and `commonSecretEnv` sections, which are used in all services.

If you don't provide a `secretKey` (used to encode JWT tokens), the image will generate one for you.

Please use the original [docker-compose file](../docker/docker-compose.prod.yaml) for reference. Look at the [original configuration template](../docker/.env.prod.template) for more informations about the available variables.

## Upload your map

Open your browser and go to https://< your-domain >/map-storage/.

You will be asked to authenticate. The user is 'admin' and the password is the one you set in the value `mapstorage.secretEnv.AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD`

You can upload a map as a zip file here. But it is highly recommended to use the [workadventure map starter kit](https://docs.workadventu.re/map-building/tiled-editor/) to create and maintain your maps.
